Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, making early diagnosis crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This research focuses on predicting breast cancer susceptibility using a comprehensive approach that integrates m-RNA and genetic data. In this study however, we incorporated machine learning and deep learning models to help address the research. With these machine learning and deep learning models and techniques, we formed a pipeline of models using a combination of different techniques such as L1 Regularization (Lasso), Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and lastly a Feedforward Neural Network to perform feature reduction, data augmentation, and ultimately classification. The dataset used consisted mainly of genetic data but also includes some patient metadata such as patient identifiers, treatments used, hormone information, etc. but ultimately the dataset was transformed to contain only different types of breast cancer and mRNA data. This change would allow us to utilize a deep learning model to predict what type of breast cancer a patient would have based on their genetic data. Given this, our final and best result was a combination of Lasso, Autoencoder, and SMOTE that resulted in the best accuracy, best F1-score and fastest time in predicting what breast cancer type a patient is susceptible to.
